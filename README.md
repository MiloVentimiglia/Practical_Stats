# Practical_Stats
Exercises solved for the Practical Statistics Module of Udacity's DAND: assignments and practice problems

## Overview and Structure
- The content here is from studying Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree [DAND] Term 1 course. 
- Notes taken during lectures are in .docx files
- .ipynb files are the coding exercises accomplished as part of the curriculum.
- Files in .pynb format are in Python 3, coded using either Udacity's in-course workspace or Anaconda Navigator. These files also include *Markdown* cells.

## .ipynb File Overview
- "conditional_probability_bayes_rule.ipynb" is evaluation of Cancer dataset. We compute **Conditional probabilities** of having cancer or not and False Positives
- "simpsons_paradox.ipynb" - Here, we work with Admissions Dataset to calculate proportions of majors, majors for each gender as well as acceptance rates by gender and by major.
- "simulating_coin_flips.ipynb" - Coin Flips are computed in this file using **NumPy**. We get to view how actual probabilities edge closer to theoretical numerical values as the number of flips becomes larger.
- "Sampling Distributions.ipynb" - Creating samples for students' coffee drinking habits, calculating statistics and plotting values.
